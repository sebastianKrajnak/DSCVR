# DSCVR - React-native app
TUKE School project for Web Applications class.
Application works similar to Pokemon GO where the user sees pins on the map with interesting architectural buildings however to view some
information about the building or add it to their favourites they have to get closer to the building. The app also allowed users to request 
an addition of buildings they found which was pending for admin confirmation.

I would like to rework this whole app one day when I'll be more free.

## Application data

All architectural data was taken from https://www.register-architektury.sk. The data was hosted on some (again forgot the name) free database
so it might've been deleted already.

## Running the app

Honestly I wrote this app quite early in my programming studies so I forgot (this readme was written way way later) how I was running it but I think I was using Expo to run it using

`npm expo start`

TODO: try relaunching the app if you have time

## Demo video

Demo for the app can be seen in this unlisted video https://youtu.be/LzWyVw6XzdU
