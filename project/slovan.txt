Oelschläger Ľudovít 
1927

The cinema building was built within the backyard of a historic building on Košice's main square. Despite the cramped spatial situation, L. Oelschläger undertook the assignment comprehensively, using the entire slide of his favorite architectural articles. The entrance to the cinema space is highlighted by six conically upwardly expanding columns with lanterns instead of heads, on the first floor there are elevated arcaded windows and the facade is closed by a high attic with an arched ornament. In a concentrated show of motifs characteristic of Oelschläger, a similarity with the work of the Slovenian architect J. Plečnik can be observed in places.
